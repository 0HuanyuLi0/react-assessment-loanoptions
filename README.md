### Instructions

- Based on the API information, structure the table columns and naming 
- Add three buttons, ‘LOAD’ , ‘DELETE’ and ‘ADD’
- When ‘LOAD’ is clicked, fetch the information and display the results on the table 
- When ‘DELETE’ is clicked, remove the last item of the table
- When ‘ADD’ is clicked, insert the ﬁrst item of the table to the last (ﬁrst item should remain as it is )
